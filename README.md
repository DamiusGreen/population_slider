# Population Slider

With this project I wanted to challenge myself by exploring how to create 
a range slider in JavaScript and jQuery, but I also wanted it to be useful. I also 
wanted to provide a table that updates in realtime based off the sliders range.
I then provided the data source along with some aesthetics using CSS.
